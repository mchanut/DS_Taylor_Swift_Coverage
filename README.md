# Background

This is the final project of COMP370: Introduction to Data Science taught by Professor Derek Ruths in Fall 2023 at McGill University.

We are a team acting as if they had been hired by a media company that wants to understand how Taylor Swift is being covered in the media. They have indicated that they are especially concerned with North American coverage and
(1) whether coverage is positive or negative
(2) what topics the coverage focuses on.
We will conduct this analysis and submit a report discussing our findings.
